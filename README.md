This space is where I share the work I've done, what I'm learning, and what I care about. It’s a place that reflects who I am and what I’ve been building over time.

## What You’ll Find Here

- A collection of my past projects
- Notes about things I’ve created or contributed to
- Some thoughts and ideas I’ve been exploring
- A little bit about me, my interests, and what drives me

Whether you're here out of curiosity or interest, I’m glad you stopped by.
